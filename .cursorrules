# WebsiteAutomation Coding Style Guide

This document defines the coding style and conventions to be used in this repository.

## General Guidelines

- All scripts should be self-contained and executable by pasting into a browser console
- Each script should have a descriptive comment header explaining its purpose and usage
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) features where appropriate
- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting

## JavaScript Conventions

### File Structure

- Begin with a comment block describing the script's purpose
- Define functions rather than using immediately invoked function expressions
- Call the main function at the end of the file
- Group related code into logical sections with comments

### Naming Conventions

- Use `camelCase` for variables and function names
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose

### Formatting

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for JavaScript strings by default
- Exception: Use double quotes for HTML attributes within JavaScript template literals
- Add spaces after keywords and around operators
- Place opening braces on the same line as control statements
- Use semicolons at the end of statements

### Code Organization

- Group related constants at the top of functions
- Use helper functions for clarity and reusability
- Add comments for complex logic or non-obvious behavior
- Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code

### DOM Manipulation

- Use descriptive CSS selectors stored in constants
- Prefer modern DOM APIs (querySelector, etc.)
- Handle potential null/undefined values when accessing DOM elements

### Error Handling

- Include basic error handling for critical operations
- Log meaningful error messages to the console

## HTML/CSS Conventions (for generated content)

- Use proper indentation for nested HTML elements
- Include appropriate doctype and meta tags
- Use semantic HTML elements where possible
- Keep CSS rules organized and grouped by purpose

## Documentation

- Include usage instructions in the README.md
- Document any known limitations or potential issues
- Provide clear examples of expected behavior

## Security Considerations

- Avoid collecting or transmitting user data
- Respect website terms of service
- Include security warnings in documentation
- Sanitize any user-generated content
